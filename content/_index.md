I have been a registered nurse since 2016 and a clinical research nurse since 2021. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at the University of New Mexico, hoping to improve health outcomes for Hispanics. I am particularly interested in blood pressure in uninsured pregnant Latinas in New Mexico. To balance my schedule, I like to stay active in CrossFit and relax with my dog.
