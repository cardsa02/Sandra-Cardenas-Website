##Abstract
Forgiveness provides the opportunity for mending and strengthening relationships
between individuals and groups, forming stronger communities. Channels in which
forgiveness is taught in communities outside of church services/activities are not
well understood. The Old Order Amish (Amish, henceforward) are a religious,
insular group of people living in the United States. Forgiveness is an essential
pillar in Amish spirituality. It is deeply ingrained in Amish life based on the belief
that in order to be forgiven (by God), one must forgive the offenses/transgressions
of others. Within the Amish community, only men have formal leadership roles as
ministers and bishops, preaching about religious values such as forgiveness to
other Amish members. Other approaches to promoting forgiveness within the
Amish community are also utilized, but not as well known. The purpose of this
chapter is to examine how the Amish intentionally instil forgiveness in their
children through multiple networks and strategies. Examination stems from a
focused ethnographic study about how one Amish community instils forgiveness in
its members. Interviews and observations were used to gather information
with Amish bishops, teachers, family members and community members.
Participants in this study emphasized that children should be taught about
forgiveness at an early age. Participants expressed a belief that discipline, humility
and the message conveyed in the Golden Rule teach Amish children to understand
and respect the perspectives of others, humble themselves and forgive the offenses
of others. Parents, teachers, childrenâ€™s books and even cookbooks focus on
discipline, humility and the Golden Rule. These strategies allow children to
develop a strong foundation for forgiveness, increasing the willingness and
capacity to forgive as Amish adults and community members. An better
understanding of this model of forgiveness can help identify the proactive
strategies and approaches that build communities with a readiness to forgive.
